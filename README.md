# Expolratory Data Analysis (EDA) Capstone project on Hotel Booking

This is my first capstone project on Data analysis using different Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? what if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high no. of special requests? this hotel booking dataset helps you to explore those questions! This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, no. of adults, children, and/or babies, and no. of available parking spaces among other things. All personal identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

Let's talk about different fields of the dataset and their description.

# EDA majorly consists four steps. These are the following:

# 1. Analyze the data

# 2. Modeling the data

# 3. Infer the data

# 4. Interperate the data

# Based on these four steps we take upcoming decisions for our business.
